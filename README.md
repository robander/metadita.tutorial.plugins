Each of these plugins goes with a tutorial originally posted at http://metadita.org/toolkit/

Specifics:
1. `org.metadita.happyhtml`: Happy HTML! How to create a "new transformation type" without
actually creating a new format. Based on the tutorial [Happy HTML for happier content](http://metadita.org/toolkit/happyhtml.html).
